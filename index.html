                    I am a Kansas City native. I grew up primarily in Johnson County and currently live in Olathe, KS. I enjoy living here because of Olathe's small town feel, its surrounding nature and wildlife and its proximity to downtown Kansas City. It's the best of
                    both worlds, suburbia and city life.
                </p>

                    I have always been a problems solver and one of those whom just loves technology. I have always gravitated toward it in my professional career. Throughout my 20+ years at Hallmark Cards, I was always given the latest technology to work with, given that
                    I would put it to good use. I was the go-to technology representative in my area and while the average employeed had one computer, I had an iMac, two Macbook Pros, and a PC laptop, all with admin rights and the ability to create and
                    share scripts I wrote to improve effieciencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was also the system administrator on Hallmark’s Digital Asset Management system, which contains 14+ million assets and has 6,000 employee users. As the subject matter expert on the system, I served as the first line of defense for users/clients needing
                    assistance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy getting to know the users as I assist them in troubleshooting their issues. Upon leaving my last role, I had users tell me that I was going to be missed and some touted me as their “Savior” (or even “Messiah”). I was always willing to do whatever
                    was necessary to resolve their issues promptly and enthusiastically. There was no question or problem that was too small or inconsequential. I continuously strived to know the system’s processes and functionality to its fullest and
                    was always yearning to learn more. I am always looking for ways to improve processes and was able to develop and implement efficiencies that benefited anyone who interacted with the system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last project I worked on with a small diversified team tasked with developing and deploying a new web-based Digital Asset Management system. I became the user champion and developed UX solutions within the software that met the needs of each business
                    served by the system. I also developed workflows within the software to improve efficiencies. After working with the analysts on troubleshooting the software as we implemented improvements and deployments, as well as driving the best
                    user experience, I wanted to learn more about both the backend and front end coding. Thus, I am here at KU Coding Bootcamp. I cant wait to see what is in store for me.
